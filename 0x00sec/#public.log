11:40 < PaperSkin> Noooooo
11:42 < PaperSkin> Leeky are you gonna continue your Operating system series??
11:43 < Leeky> yes I'm
11:43 < Leeky> but busy with final exams 'n stuff
11:43 < PaperSkin> Yes! thought you forgot about ti for a minute
11:43 < Leeky> yeah it looks that way doesn't it?
11:44 < Leeky> it's just that it takes some time, expecially as I want to include good references for further reading
11:45 < PaperSkin> oh, how big of a task is creating the operating system?
11:47 < Leeky> not too much, I would guess I would only need ~10h to finish it (w/ documenting it or writing on the post)
11:48 < Leeky> that's half a week end for me, but currently those are occupied with learning for school, reading into new stuff and working on random shit
11:48 < PaperSkin> Lol, I wouldn't think you need it to be honest you seem very intelligent, should be a breeze
11:48 < Leeky> spring break is when I planned to work on the OS

11:49 < Leeky> physics tho~ need a viable grade~ so much to learn~
11:52 < Leeky> not to mention that I have to finish the most retarded project I've ever started, Crosscompiling Java Bytecode to x86. [Including writing the whole tooline from parsing class files, translating them, assembling the x86 and then linking/creating PE files out it myself]
11:53 < Leeky> soo close to being done with that beyond PoC
11:54 < PaperSkin> Also I have a question, how come you chose real mode and not something like protected mode, isn't real mode old?
11:54 < Leeky> well
11:54 < Leeky> realmode is where cpus start in
11:55 < Leeky> almost every x86 cpi
11:55 < Leeky> *cpu
11:56 < Leeky> so realmode code execution is the first thing the CPU does until switching to protected mode, why should I start learning/researching the 2nd thing if I can start from the beginning?
11:56 < PaperSkin> Oh i see
11:56 < Leeky> [Excluding UEFI magix here, I'm trying to pretend it doesn't exist]
11:59 < Leeky> PaperSkin: as a matter of fact the PoC of my JVM Bytecode -> x86  assembler was meant to target realmode execution and made it possible to write a realmode in Java :P (sorry too proud of it, although I'm aware that it's 100% useless)
12:00 < Leeky> *realmode OS
12:01 < PaperSkin> Wait so your gonna write a program to change java byte code to x86 eliminating the ened for you to use assembly??
12:02 < PaperSkin> Omg that sounds cool, I wanna see that.
12:02 < Leeky> I already have that in a PoC level, PoC didn't support OOP though, rewritten version does :P
12:02 < Leeky> gimme 15 minutes and I can finnaly put the time in to put it on github
12:02 < Leeky> *putting
12:02 < FFY00> Leeky if you need help
12:02 < FFY00> I have worked with bytecode
12:03 < fxbg|away> big
12:03 < PaperSkin> Why not something procedural like c then?
12:03 < Leeky> FFY00: my class parser works perfect already sorry .D
12:03 < FFY00> np
12:03 < FFY00> :)
12:03 < fxbg|away> byte order in java?
12:03 < FFY00> just saying
12:04 < Leeky> PaperSkin: because I want to make it standalone, and I'm not going to write a C compiler
12:04 < Leeky> byte order? most of it works by indexing a constant pool
12:04 < fxbg|away> thought we were talking endianness nvm
12:04 < fxbg|away> beer > thought
12:05 < Leeky> .D

12:08 < Leeky> because why not :P
12:08 < PaperSkin> You make all of it sound so easy, How long did it take you to learn all of this?
12:08 < fxbg|away> to x86?
12:08 < fxbg|away> why
12:08 < Leeky> PaperSkin: learning while doing
12:09 < fxbg|away> wouldnt you do that from the other end?
12:09 < PaperSkin> oh makes sense!
12:10 < PaperSkin> so when you continue your series your gonna use java from now on?
12:11 < Leeky> lol no
12:11 < Leeky> as if anyone would like to see that
12:12 < Leeky> but that sounds like something I have to remember for the 1st April
12:12 < fxbg|away> i write java on toilet paper, then jswing it into you know where.
12:13 < PaperSkin> your ass to wipe after you..?
12:13 < fxbg|away> yes, i wipe my ass with it.
12:14 < Leeky> isn't that the intented porpouse of it?
12:14 < nugget> Leeky, I would like to see it
12:14 < nugget> been a while since I had a good laugh
12:14 < Leeky> gimme time to write a proper readmee
12:15 < nugget> what is this video series anyhow
12:15 < nugget> some sort of basics of programming or something
12:15 < Leeky> video series?
12:15 < Leeky> realmode series you mean?
12:15 < nugget> I presumed it was video series you was foing
12:15 < nugget> doing*
12:15 < fxbg|away> ahhh shit dont get me starts.
12:15 < Leeky> nugget: do you even read stuff on the forumz?
12:15 < nugget> Leeky, rarely
12:15 < fxbg|away> i was wondering too.
12:15 < nugget> Leeky, I really just use it for blogging to py
12:15 < fxbg|away> was sure in was up to date.
12:15 < PaperSkin> Tbh threads rarelypop up
12:15 < PaperSkin> on the forum
12:16 < Leeky> nugget: ah, it's a "walkthrough" of writing realmode assembly
12:16 < Leeky> BIOS stuff and things
12:16 < nugget> ah
12:16 < nugget> you should video'ize it 
12:16 < fxbg|away> yikes
12:16 < Leeky> hell no
12:17 < fxbg|away> i c now
12:17 < fxbg|away> https://0x00sec.org/search?q=realmode
12:17 < FFY00> anyone knows good resources on search engine algorithms?
12:17 < FFY00> I was thinking about implementing a se in go
12:17 < fxbg|away> go?!
12:17 < FFY00> yes
12:18 < fxbg|away> bah
12:18 < FFY00> why?
12:18 < PaperSkin> go as in the programming language, lmao i only found otu about it becuse i was trying to type google into my address bar and though it would autocomplete so i was left with go
12:18  * fxbg|away checks for your hipster stache
12:19 < PaperSkin> Wouldnt a search engine algorithim just be a long ass loop
12:19 < PaperSkin> ?
12:19 < FFY00> no
12:20 < PaperSkin> oh lol
12:20 < FFY00> I need to select the information to store
12:20 < FFY00> I'm not gonna store all the text lol
12:21 < Leeky> aarrg
12:21 < Leeky> hmm
12:21 < FFY00> Leeky?
12:21 < PaperSkin> Lmao I thought he was gonna say something too
12:21 < PaperSkin> relating to your problem
12:22 < PaperSkin> O crap my windows is about to update
12:22 < Leeky> there is more to cleanup than expected, is a .java and the resulting .asm enough as a PoC
12:23 < FFY00> if they work
12:23 < Leeky> [not to mention that I just realised that linking my github here would make doxing a one additional search thing]
12:24 < PaperSkin> ...I thought my pc would've cut off by now and the windows update start
12:24 < FFY00> switch to linux '-'
12:24 < fxbg|away> 12:20 < FFY00> I need to select the information to store
12:25 < fxbg|away> exactly
12:25 < fxbg|away> so what would you store?
12:25 < PaperSkin> I have a live linux install on a USB but idk im just not a terminal person
12:25 < Leeky> https://transfer.sh/11jXw9/f0x_example.zip
12:25 < FFY00> that why I need a algorithm
12:25 < fxbg|away> negative
12:25 -!- You're now known as fxbg
12:25 < Leeky> java source in java folder, asm result in asm folder, additional resources in res
12:25 < nugget> ok time for sleep and then trains and then work ;/ uggg catch you all soon!
12:26 < fxbg> cant catch me. 
12:26 < Leeky> PoC doesn't use a custom class parser/assembler, assembling works over nasm
12:26 < fxbg> fasmg?
12:26 < PaperSkin> What did you mean by the cleanup isssues
12:26 < PaperSkin> ??
12:27 < [0xdeadbeef]> FFY00: Google serves most of its results from RAM btw 
12:27 < fxbg> if not all
12:27 < FFY00> I am not google
12:27 < [0xdeadbeef]> A Google engineer disclosed that on Quora 
12:27 < fxbg> but that has nothing to do with what data gets marked important
12:27 < PaperSkin> They do it from memory/
12:27 < PaperSkin> ?
12:27 < Leeky> PaperSkin: my newest version isn't in a working state, my PoC has hardcoded paths for qemu, nasm, depends on external libraries, has folders for x86_16, WIN, ELF/Linux and pure i8068, also temp folders everywhere (and .bat scripts)
12:28 < Leeky> I could zip it though if you like to download a bunch of shit
12:28 < [0xdeadbeef]> FFY00: There's a db that's also insanely fast 
12:28 < [0xdeadbeef]> Can't remember what it's called
